Research Report: Predicting ICU Admissions Using Machine Learning
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an enormous burden on healthcare systems worldwide, particularly in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). With limited ICU capacity, predicting which patients are likely to require intensive care can help hospitals better allocate resources and improve patient outcomes. In this study, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict whether patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will need ICU admission. By analyzing patient data and identifying key features that contribute to ICU admission, we can create a predictive model that provides hospitals with a valuable tool for decision-making during the pandemic.

The primary goal of this research is to create an accurate and interpretable machine learning model capable of predicting ICU admissions. To achieve this, we use a dataset from the Kaggle platform, which contains various clinical variables for COVID-19 patients, including vital signs, laboratory test results, and demographic information. The findings of this study will be relevant to medical professionals and data scientists working on healthcare resource optimization during health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data Description
The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available on Kaggle and includes anonymized clinical data from patients confirmed to have COVID-19. It consists of 786 patients, with each patient characterized by a range of medical and demographic features that are relevant to their health status. Out of the total number of patients, 235 were admitted to the ICU, while 551 were not.

The dataset contains the following key attributes:

Vital Signs: Respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body temperature. These values are provided as both absolute values and differences between maximum, minimum, mean, and median readings.
Laboratory Test Results: Levels of neutrophils and other blood-related indicators that are commonly monitored in COVID-19 patients.
Demographic Information: Age, gender, and age percentile. This helps to assess whether certain age groups or gender are at higher risk of ICU admission.
ICU Admission Status: This is the target variable indicating whether the patient was admitted to the ICU (1) or not (0).
The clinical and demographic variables are critical as they allow the machine learning models to evaluate multiple dimensions of the patients' health conditions and how these factors might contribute to ICU admission.

Methods
In this study, we employ several exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods and machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for ICU admissions. Our approach follows these steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Before developing the predictive model, we explore the data to identify key patterns, relationships, and correlations. Various visualization techniques are used to better understand the data, including:

Bar charts for categorical distributions, such as ICU admissions by gender and age groups.
Density plots and scatter plots to assess relationships between vital sign differences and ICU admission status.
Pairplots to explore multivariate relationships between features.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves to examine the likelihood of ICU admission over time.
Data Preprocessing: The data contains both numerical and categorical variables, requiring different preprocessing techniques. We perform the following steps:

Handling missing data through imputation or removal of incomplete records.
Normalizing numerical features to standardize their ranges.
Encoding categorical variables, such as gender and age group, for inclusion in the machine learning model.
Feature engineering to derive relative differences in vital signs (e.g., respiratory rate difference) to capture more meaningful trends.
Feature Selection: After preprocessing, we use a feature importance ranking to determine which attributes are most predictive of ICU admission. This allows us to reduce the number of features and focus on those that provide the most insight.

Machine Learning Model Development
Given the nature of the problem—a binary classification task with imbalanced classes—we explored several machine learning algorithms to predict ICU admission. After evaluating different models, we decided to use the VotingClassifier, an ensemble learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple individual models to improve overall performance. The ensemble model is composed of the following algorithms:

Random Forest Classifier: A robust model that uses multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy.
Gradient Boosting Classifier: A boosting algorithm that builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects errors made by the previous ones.
Logistic Regression: A simple, interpretable linear model often used in binary classification tasks.
The VotingClassifier aggregates the predictions of these three models and makes the final decision based on majority voting. This ensemble approach provides a balance between accuracy and interpretability, which is essential in the healthcare domain, where decisions must be both accurate and explainable.

We opted to use the RandomForestClassifier as the base model for feature importance analysis due to its ability to rank features based on their contribution to predictions. The top features identified were:

Respiratory Rate Max
Respiratory Rate Mean
Respiratory Rate Median
Respiratory Rate Diff
Neutrophils Max
These features reflect the critical importance of respiratory and blood-related health metrics in determining the likelihood of ICU admission.

Performance Analysis
The performance of our model was evaluated using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, the ROC-AUC score, and a confusion matrix. Below are the key results:

Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix provided insight into how well the model distinguishes between patients who require ICU admission and those who do not. The model achieved a good balance between true positives (patients correctly identified as needing ICU admission) and true negatives (patients correctly identified as not needing ICU admission), with fewer false positives and false negatives.

ROC Curve and AUC Score: The ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between the true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate, with an AUC score of 0.83. This indicates that the model is effective at distinguishing between ICU and non-ICU cases, achieving a high degree of predictive accuracy.

Calibration Curve: The calibration curve showed how well the predicted probabilities align with the actual outcomes. The model exhibited strong calibration, meaning that the predicted probabilities of ICU admission closely matched the observed outcomes.

Lift Chart: The lift chart demonstrated the added value of using our model over random guessing. The lift values were consistently above 1, confirming that the model provides better-than-random predictions, particularly for higher-probability predictions.

Partial Dependence Plot: The partial dependence plot for Respiratory Rate Mean revealed a clear relationship between this feature and the likelihood of ICU admission. As the respiratory rate increased, the probability of ICU admission also increased, confirming that respiratory function is a key indicator in determining the severity of COVID-19 cases.

Conclusion
In this study, we successfully developed and validated a machine learning model to predict ICU admissions for COVID-19 patients. Our findings indicate that respiratory rate, age, and certain blood markers such as neutrophils are among the most important predictors of ICU admission. The model, a VotingClassifier ensemble, achieved an AUC score of 0.83, demonstrating its ability to make accurate predictions.

By providing hospitals with an early warning system for ICU admissions, this model can help healthcare providers allocate resources more effectively and prioritize care for high-risk patients. In the context of a global pandemic, such tools are crucial for managing healthcare capacity and improving patient outcomes.

The data used for this study was sourced from Kaggle, where the dataset was made publicly available for research purposes. Future research could focus on incorporating additional clinical features or external data sources, such as comorbidities or socioeconomic factors, to further refine the model's predictive capabilities.

Through our analysis, we hope to contribute to the growing body of work on the application of machine learning in healthcare, particularly in times of crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. Further advancements in predictive modeling can empower healthcare systems with actionable insights to better serve patients in need of critical care.
